# R-Portfolio
My own projects created using R

I'm including projects I've done myself using R. I'm going to explain what I did and why in order to make my actions clear to all who have 
patience to view this Portfolio. Thanks for stopping by and I hope that you got some kind on insight what I'm capable of doing using
the magnificient R-software. Happy coding!
